    "#### Data Preprocessing  [4 points]\n",
    "1. Read the text data from the csv file\n",
    "2. Convert the variable into corresponding feature vectors as below. Perform pre-processing step of stopword removal , special character removal , converting the text to the lower case , remove Url’s if any  from text.  [1 pt]\n",
    "3. For each title text, convert it into corresponding TF-IDF vector. [1 pt]\n",
    "4. TF-IDF vectors are sparse and of large dimension. Reduce them into only 2 dimensions using PCA. [2 pt]\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Perform K-means clustering for different values of K (2,3,4) and evaluate the quality of clustering using Silhouette score. [4 points]\n",
    "1. For each value of K, plot clusters (all cluster points in same cluster with same color, cluster points in different cluster in different colors). [2 pt]\n",
    "2. Draw a bar graph with X-axis as K value and Y-axis as silhouette score. [1 pt]\n",
    "3. Explain (1-2 lines) which is the best clustering and why. [1 pt]\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Consider the pre-processed text of all the sentences and find words that frequently occur together. [4 points]\n",
    "1. More specifically, find association rules of minimum length 2 with 20% confidence and 10% support. Other parameters you are free to decide on your own. How many such rules are there? List all the rules. Interpret any one rule. [2 pt]\n",
    "2. Draw a line graph with Y-axis as number of association rules of minimum length 2, and X-axis as confidence percentage (ranging from 0%, 10%, 20%, ...., 100%). Plot different colored lines for different support percentage (take values as 10%, 20%, and 50%) [2 pt]"
